<SpecSection title="What this feature specifies" id="what-this-feature-specifies">
`ABI versioning and compatibility` defines one operational contract that a newcomer can follow end-to-end: first the model, then execution flow, then strict guarantees, concrete examples, and verification guidance.
</SpecSection>

<SpecSection title="Implementation anchors" id="implementation-anchors">
- `AbiVersion` and compatibility definitions in `compiler/crates/beskid_abi/src/lib.rs`
- `RUNTIME_EXPORT_SYMBOLS` in `compiler/crates/beskid_abi/src/symbols.rs`
- JIT/runtime symbol loading in `compiler/crates/beskid_engine/src/jit_module.rs`
- Runtime exports in `compiler/crates/beskid_runtime/src/lib.rs`
</SpecSection>
