This article collects **FAQ** entries for **Syntax domain model generation**.

## Why separate language-meta and compiler pages?
Language-meta defines Beskid-side mod contracts; this compiler area defines how the Rust host executes them safely and incrementally.

## Can meta call arbitrary FFI?
No — unless explicitly granted by platform policy and declared in compilation capabilities. Default contracts deny ambient FFI.

## Where do Roslyn/KSP parallels apply?
Only as rationale for incremental caches and typed models; Beskid contracts are authoritative here, not foreign tool behavior.
