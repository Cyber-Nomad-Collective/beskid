This article collects **examples** for **mod host bridge** (informative sketches aligned with contracts).

## Example A — Minimal query
A compile-time module reads a syntax attribute using the query API, then emits a diagnostic without mutating syntax.

## Example B — Emitter sketch
A contributor constructs a new method declaration through `Beskid.Compiler.Emit`, attaches trivia, and registers it with the incremental graph.

> Executable snippets will track the reference implementation as mod host execution lands in the compiler; until then, treat these as specification fixtures.
