This article states **contracts and edge cases** for **Syntax domain model generation**.

## Hard requirements
- **Deterministic ordering** — discovery and execution order must be reproducible from equal inputs (path-normalized roots, sorted files, stable tie-breaks).
- **Bounded work** — host enforces step limits, allocation caps, and recursion depth across nested meta calls.
- **Versioned facades** — `Beskid.Compiler` surface is tied to compiler language version tokens exposed on the compilation instance.

## Edge cases
- **Partial programs** — facades must tolerate incomplete syntax where the language permits; diagnostics are preferred over host panics.
- **Conflicting edits** — multiple meta contributors touching the same declaration identity produce a deterministic merge failure surfaced as structured diagnostics.
